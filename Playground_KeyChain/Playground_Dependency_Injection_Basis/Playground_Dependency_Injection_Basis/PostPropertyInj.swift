            PROPERTY INJECTION
 
 Sometimes initializer injection is hard to do, because your class have to inherit from a system class.
 This makes the process really hard if you have to work with views or controllers.
 A good solution for this situation is to use a property-based injection design pattern.
 
 Maybe you can't have full control over initialization, but you can always control your properties.
 The only disadvantage is that you have to check if that property is already presented (being set) or not, before you do anything with it. ðŸ¤«

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case title
        case content
    }
    
    init(title: String, content: String) {
        self.title = title
        self.content = content
    }
