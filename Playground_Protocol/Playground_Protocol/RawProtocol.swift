    Protocol can be used as a `Type`

/*
 In a certain way this is a "reverse" subclassing:
This could have been done by making `Human` and `Animal` sublassing some class as `LivingThing` which could have a name and an age property, and overriding them
 
But when there are multiplie protocols, and that some functions requires more protocols, it doesn't work  with subclass
 
     protocol A
     protocol B
     protocol C

     class X : A, B
     class Y : B, C
     class Z : A, C
 
 Subclassing doesn't work here

/*
 
 Protocol can be used as type. This means that we can define a function
 
     func printAge( someClass: Aged ) {
         print(someClass.age)
     }
     // We don't need to know the "real" type of `someClass` because we only need to access this method
 
 
 That also works with variables, and that is exactly what happens with Delegation !

    let dog = Dog(age: 7, name: "Tical")
